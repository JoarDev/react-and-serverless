## What is this repo about?

This repo contains the project that i created in the [React and Serverless - Fullstack Web Development course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-and-serverless/) by James Quick.

It was super fun to build this project and James is an excellent instructor. I didn't know too much about the technologies (see below) he used for making the project and i'm be sure i will make use of them in future projects
